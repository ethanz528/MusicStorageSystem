###Music Storage System

The project I am designing this semester is a **music storage system**. Things the application can do include:

<ul>
<li>Add songs to store in your library</li>
<li>Remove music from your library</li>
<li>Create and edit multiple named playlists</li>
<li>Play music, skip songs and skip throughout a song</li>
<li>Adjust the speed of the song playing</li>
<li>Get information about your library and playlists</li>
<li>Know which songs your listen to the most</li>
</ul>

This application will be used by people who need a program to store and organize their music. I decided to make this
project because I listen to music a lot, and I do not have an application I can use to organize and sort my music files.
