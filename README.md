## Music Storage System

The project I am designing this semester is a **music storage system**. Things the application can do include:

<ul>
<li>Add songs to store in your library</li>
<li>Remove music from your library</li>
<li>Create and edit multiple named playlists</li>
<li>Play music and skip songs</li>
<li>Get information about your library and playlists</li>
</ul>

This application will be used by people who need a program to store and organize their music. I decided to make this
project because I listen to music a lot, and I do not have an application I can use to organize and sort my music files.

#### User Stories

<ul>
<li>As a user, I want to be able to add and remove songs to my music library</li>
<li>As a user, I want to be able to create multiple playlists</li>
<li>As a user, I want to be able to add and remove songs from the playlists</li>

<li>As a user, I want to be able to play music and skip songs</li>
</ul>
